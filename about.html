            <p>Hello! Welcome to my personal website. My full name is Ryan Stuart Hicks, originally born as Christopher Leckness (middle name unknown). I was born in Birmingham, AL by a lovely woman who was too young to raise two children all by herself. My birth mother's family is originally from Germany. Her grandfather moved to the United States with Werner von Braun and his team to help build the Saturn V rocket which was used during the Apollo missions to help the United States land on the moon. My twin brother, Andrew, and I were both adopted at a very young age by a wonderful family in the Huntsille, AL area. We could not have asked for a better mother and father. My mother is a saint, currently working in the social work industry as a case manager helping injured employees reenter the workforce. My father--although an asshole at times--is one of my primary role models, currently serving the United States by working as an engineer for the nation's space and defense industry.</p>
            <p>I grew up loving sports and playing video games. I was a naturally intelligent child and managed to excel through school while playing a variety of sports such as baseball, football, soccer, and basketball.By the time college crept up, I thought I was invincible. I enrolled at the University of Alabama and began studying to become an Aerospace Engineer. Unfortunately, I was totally unprepared for both the time commitment and the level of maturity required to move forward at the collegiate level. I endured many emotional hardships, and to make things as clear as possible, <b>I FAILED</b>. It was one of the hardest things in the world to be forced to sit back and watch while the rest of the world moved forward. I say this to clarify that life is not a race. Most of us aren't even sure where the finish line is. So, what exactly are we racing towards? Life is a cycle of experiences that we must learn from in order to grow and to move forward. I was readmitted to the University of Alabama two years later and chose to participate in the Capstone MIS Program. This was one of the best decisions that I have ever made. The University of Alabama's MIS Program taught me the business skills, technical skills, and soft skills needed to be succesful. I graduated in December of 2017 and have since been working for myself on a personal project called 256 Technology. It is my mission to enable individuals to enable themselves. I am currently focusing on providing productivity and organization tools that will influence an indivdual to take control of his or her life. In doing so, I hope to ultimtely accelerate the technological evolution of society. <a href = "https://www.256technology.com">Want to learn more?</a> Although 256 Technology is my passion, I am also currently seeking a full-time position as a full-stack software engineer. My pinnacle goal is to work as a program manager for the U.S. government's space and defense industry while continuing to educate and to inspire anyone that I come into contact with. If you learn anything from reading this, please understand that failure is only temporary. Carry on! &#9774; &amp; &hearts;.</p>
